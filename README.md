Solidus extension to integrate Paysafe as a payment provider.

## Installation

Add solidus_paysafe to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'solidus_paysafe'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bin/rails generate solidus_paysafe:install
```

Add the paysafe.js script to the head of your HTML:
```html
<script src="https://hosted.paysafe.com/js/v1/latest/paysafe.min.js"></script>
```

## Usage

Navigate to *Settings > Payments > Payment Methods* in the admin panel.
You can now create a new payment method that uses Paysafe by selecting
`Paysafe` under Type in the New Payment Method form and saving.
The Paysafe payment method's extra fields will be now shown in the form.

**Configure via database configuration**

If you want to store your Paysafe credentials in the database just
fill the new fields in the form, selecting `custom` (default) in the
Preference Source field.

**Configure via static configuration**

If you want to store your credentials into your codebase or use ENV
variables you can create the following static configuration:

```ruby
# config/initializers/spree.rb

Spree.config do |config|
  # ...

  # The following example uses Rails credentials, you can also use ENV variables instead.
  config.static_model_preferences.add(
    SolidusPaysafe::PaymentMethod,
    'paysafe_env_credentials',
    test_mode: Rails.application.credentials.dig(:paysafe, :test_mode),
    api_key: Rails.application.credentials.dig(:paysafe, :api_key),
    api_secret: Rails.application.credentials.dig(:paysafe, :api_secret),
    account_number: Rails.application.credentials.dig(:paysafe, :account_number),
    single_use_token_key: Rails.application.credentials.dig(:paysafe, :single_use_token_key),
    single_use_token_secret: Rails.application.credentials.dig(:paysafe, :single_use_token_secret)
  )
end
```

Once your server has been restarted, you can select in the Preference
Source field a new entry called `paysafe_env_credentials`. After saving,
your  application will start using the static configuration to process
Paysafe payments.

## Development

### Testing the extension

First bundle your dependencies, then run `bin/rake`. `bin/rake` will default to building the dummy
app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using
`bin/rake extension:test_app`.

```shell
bin/rake
```

To run [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) static code analysis run

```shell
bundle exec rubocop
```

When testing your application's integration with this extension you may use its factories.
Simply add this require statement to your `spec/spec_helper.rb`:

```ruby
require 'solidus_paysafe/testing_support/factories'
```

Or, if you are using `FactoryBot.definition_file_paths`, you can load Solidus core
factories along with this extension's factories using this statement:

```ruby
SolidusDevSupport::TestingSupport::Factories.load_for(SolidusPaysafe::Engine)
```

### Running the sandbox

To run this extension in a sandboxed Solidus application, you can run `bin/sandbox`. The path for
the sandbox app is `./sandbox` and `bin/rails` will forward any Rails commands to
`sandbox/bin/rails`.

Here's an example:

```
$ bin/rails server
=> Booting Puma
=> Rails 6.0.2.1 application starting in development
* Listening on tcp://127.0.0.1:3000
Use Ctrl-C to stop
```

### Updating the changelog

Before and after releases the changelog should be updated to reflect the up-to-date status of
the project:

```shell
bin/rake changelog
git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "Update the changelog"
```

### Releasing new versions
